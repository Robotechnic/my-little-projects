			<p class="project__description">I first saw this flip clock on youtube and I think that this is a good idea to make my own version of it.<br/> My concern is that this is not a good idea to make a flip clock becauthe after, I can take the code and customize it to display whatever I want like nubers of sell for a merchandising website, a countdown to a specific date. Or whatever I want.</p>
